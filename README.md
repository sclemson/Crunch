# Crunch - SEI Project 2

# Overview

Crunch is a fun number-guzzling app that was pair coded (with [Simon Clemson](https://github.com/sclemson)) over a 48-hour period. The project was our first experience using React, and consumes four endpoints from an external API.

# The Brief

The web-app must:

- Consume a public API.
- Have several components.
- Use `react-router-dom` for routing.

# Technologies Used

#### Front-End

- React
- Sass
- Axios
- React Router Dom

#### Public API

- Numbers API - [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/#42)

#### Development Tools

- Postman
- Netlify (deployment)
- Git & GitHub

# Approach

## 1) Planning

Due to the project having a strict 48-hour deadline, the planning stage had to be completed over approximately half a day. The first stage was to agree on a suitable external API to use. We settled on the Numbers API, before creating a wireframe and some pseudocode ahead of starting the actual build.
The four external API endpoints that we used were:

- GET a date fact, using a day and a month.
- GET a maths fact, using an integer.
- GET a number fact, using an integer.
- GET a series of year facts, each using a year.

It was agreed that the MVP would consist of the above four trivia outputs, but with the year fact only containing one input. We agreed on using Sass (scss) for the enhanced ability to use theming and variables for the project, as well as for the experience of using it within a project for the first time.

## 2) Front-End

In our first experience with using React, we created four Axios requests to receive the relevant endpoints. We used an accompanying component for each one that handled the user’s input and sent said input to be rendered via the Axios request. We decided to show all of the web-app’s functionality within one main page, which in hindsight was a great way to understand the power of state in React.
For our year fact section, we had the idea to allow the user to enter as many years as they wished. The styling of the ‘timeline’ would then reflect the relative position of each year entered. The facts would then all be revealed at once after submission. Snippets of both the year input and output are included below:

## 3) Styling

As mentioned, Sass was used for the styling of a project. No styling libraries were used. After the functionality of the app was completed, we created the about page and designed the Crunch logo. Due to the strict timeframe of the project we kept the design fairly minimalistic but clean.

# Wins & Blockers

### **Wins**

- First experience of using React and understanding the power and ease of useState and useEffect.
- Pair coding a project in a 48-hour deadline over Zoom was a great way to develop both planning and collaborative skills.

### **Blockers**

- Due to not having used React before, understanding how to efficiently handle state variables took a little time initially.

# Bugs

- Unfortunately, the Numbers API that we used only has an `http` address, meaning the CORS request is refused by browsers in the deployed version. We are looking to resolve this soon.

# Future Improvements

- Have the year fact list appear more as a timeline stylistically.
- Add a feature for each fact that can provide a random input at the user’s request.

# Key Takeaways

Working in a team for the first time was a great experience of how to problem-solve together. The approach was congruent throughout, and our goals for any set period were always clear and ultimately achieved. The ability to talk through a plan with a colleague and clearly lay out what needed doing further emphasised the importance of this aspect of development. Additionally creating a first project using React was instrumental in highlighting its power, and I will definitely seek to use the framework in many future projects.
